# Milestone 4

We have added the translation of the tracking into actual inputs. Also the system ius able to differentiate between left and right hands and handle the inputs differently.

so the right wrist position is mapped to mouse movement, and pincching of the right hand is translated into clicking the mouse.

Left pincching toggles microsofts one-screen keyboard through the hotkey "winkey + ctrl + o"
