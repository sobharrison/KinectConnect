# Milestone 1 Demo Project

This code is just the very basics of OpenCV adapted from a tutorial video.

It takes in the rgb frames from the kinect and displayes them as a video feed in a window.

Note: if you're not getting a video feed changing the cv2.VideoCapture() to either 1 or 0 (or sometimes in rare cases 2 and beyond) to get the video feed from the desired camera.
